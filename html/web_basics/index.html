		<h2>Hunting in the City!</h2>
			<p>I have learned that when one visits a city like Chicago, one must take advantage of such an excellent opportunity. No, I'm not <em>necessarily</em> talking about the tourist spots; I'm talking Pokemon Go!!</p>

			<p>My Sunday in Chicago was <strong>awesome</strong> because I caught a bunch of awesome Pokemon and gathered a lot of neat items from the PokeStops.</p>

			<p>I caught many new Pokemon:</p>

			<ol>
				<li>Growlithe</li>
				<li>Magnemite</li>
				<li>Horsea</li>
				<li>Dratini</li>
				<li>Squirtle</li>
				<li>Voltorb</li>
				<li>Doduo</li>
				<li>Slowpoke</li>
				<li>Gastly</li>
			</ol>
		<p>I also filled up my bag with a great assortment of items:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Poke Balls</li>
				<li>Great Balls</li>
				<li>Ultra Balls</li>
				<li>Health Items
					<ul>
						<li>Potions</li>
						<li>Super Potions</li>
						<li>Hyper Potions</li>
						<li>Revives</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Pokemon Eggs</li>
			</ul>
		<p>I had a great time walking around with friends along Lake Michigan on a beautiful fall day!! To learn more about how you can catch 'em all, visit the <a href="http://www.pokemongo.com/en-us/">Pokemon Go</a> website and get out there, Trainer!!
