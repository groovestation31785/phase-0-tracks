Algorithm for Using an Elevator

-Starting position should be in front of the elevator doors.
	-There will be a small panel with two bottoms. One has an arrow point up, the other down. If the destination is upward:
		-Push the bottom with the up arrow.
		-Otherwise push the downward arrow.
	-If the elevator has arrived with open doors:
		-Enter the elevator.
	-Otherwise:
		-Continue to wait for elevator doors to open.

-Once inside the elevator:
	-Find a panel with a combination of numbered and lettered buttons.
	-Determine the floor that has the destination:
		-For traveling to the main floor:
			-Find the button with a star next to the number or letter.
			-Push it so that it lights up.
			-Wait for the doors to close and for the elevator to move.
			-If the doors open:
				-Determine if you have arrived at the destination by reading the elevator's current location above the elevator doors.
					-If it indicates you are on the main floor:
						-Leave the elevator
					-Otherwise:
						-Verify that the button is still illuminated:
							-If it is not illuminated:
								-Press it again.
								-Wait for the elevator to continue moving.
						-Wait for the doors to close and for the elevator to move.
		-For traveling to any other floor in the building:
			-Find the button of the floor with the destination:
				-Start the search at the bottom of the panel:
					-For a panel with two columns:
						-Search the left column for an odd-numbered floor and right for an even-numbered floor
					-For a panel with three columns:
						-If the floor number is less than 3:
							-Press the matching number from the bottom row of buttons
						-While dividing by 3
							-If the floor number has a modulo equal to 1
								-Search the left column
							-If the floor number has a modulo equal to 2
								-Search the middle column
							-If the floor number has a modulo equal to 0
								-Search the right column
					-For a panel with four columns:
						-If the floor number is less than 4:
							-Press the matching number from the bottom row of buttons
						-While dividing by 4
							-If the floor number has a modulo equal to 1
								-Search the first column
							-If the floor number has a modulo equal to 2
								-Search the second column
							-If the floor number has a modulo equal to 3
								-Search the third column
							-If the floor number has a modulo equal to 0
								-Search the fourth column
					-For a panel with five columns:
						-If the floor number is less than 5:
							-Press the matching number from the bottom row of buttons
						-While dividing by 5
							-If the floor number has a modulo equal to 1
								-Search the first column
							-If the floor number has a modulo equal to 2
								-Search the second column
							-If the floor number has a modulo equal to 3
								-Search the third column
							-If the floor number has a modulo equal to 4
								-Search the fourth column
							-If the floor number has a modulo equal to 5
								-Search the fifth column
					-For a panel with six columns:
						-Since you are located in a building that is extremely large:
							-Notify your human that you need assistance.
							-Never maneuver through a building of this size without your human counterpart.
			-When the floor button has been found:
				-Press the button so that it is illuminated.
				-Wait for the elevator doors to close and for it to move.
				-If the doors open:
					-Determine if you have arrived at the destination by reading the elevator's current location above the elevator doors.
						-If it indicates you have arrived at the correct:
							-Leave the elevator
						-Otherwise:
							-Verify that the button is still illuminated:
								-If it is not illuminated:
									-Press it again.
									-Wait for the elevator to continue moving.
-If you are completely lost and have created a disruption in the building:
	-Notity your human of any malfeasance.
	-Initiate the "Return Home" sequence
