DECRYPT PSEUDOCODE
Ask the user to type a password:
	-Cycle through each character to find its corresponding index number within the alphabet
	-Substract that index's number by one
	-Retrieve the new index number
	-Match the letter with the corresponding index
	-For every space character:
		-Do not move the space to the previous character.
		-Use the space character
	-Continue through all the letters until you reach the end of the given string
