# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Version control is a way for a developer take files from the cloud, work on them, then return them for others to use/see. It is useful because it creates a pattern for developers to follow when exchanging code. It is also important because it backs up the work.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A branch lets us work on a specific task within in the code that can later be merged onto the master. It is helps with fixing bugs and making small changes without being on the master branch.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
A commit is preparing the files to be pushed into Github. A good commit message is short but gives a good description of what change was just made.

* What is a merge conflict?
A merge conflict occurs the two branches that need to be merged have different changes by different people, and Git is unsure of which changes it should use.
