## Research Web Servers

#### Philosophies of Linux OS

	Linux is an open-source operating system that gives the user much more control over the way it functions. I have seen it referenced as "the hacker's operating system." People from all over the Internet have contributed to the code and have made it available for anyone to use. Linux offers the user a lot of freedom and reliability.

#### VPS

	A virtual private server can be described as a smaller server within a larger server. Each individual server has its own operating system and uses its own server resources so that it can function independently within the larger server. This can keep any issues contained within its allocated 'space' and not affect the others. Different websites can have their own VPS that is all shared on one physical machine. The cost of VPS hosting is one advantage: users can customize their features which means they only pay for what they use. Users have a lot more control over the virtual server than with shared hosting; and when there are issues, there is no need for VPS-specific support because issues with shared hosting are the same as with VPS.

#### Root in Linux

	In Linux, the Root user is similar to the Administrator user on Windows. When the Root user makes changes, this could negatively affect the security of the OS. Applications are meant to be run with non-admin security; applications running with root privileges can expose any vulnerability with makes it accessible to viruses.
