## jQuery 

#### Make a plan

1. I went through the CodeAcademy course on jQuery about a year ago and I rememeber it being EXTREMELY helpful. It really pointed out how simple jQuery can be. It's straightforward and does not require hardcore programming understanding. 
2. The plan is to spend maybe an hour going through the material. I won't get through all of it, but it will jumpstart my learning so I can look up materials at jQuery. I want to look through the documentation/library and familiarize myself with all that I could do.
3. Luckily, CodeAcademy has small projects and exercises for me to do throughout the course. I would be able to do many little things to try out my skills.
4. I do think that little breaks here and there are important. I plan to take a stroll around the house two or three times during this study session.
